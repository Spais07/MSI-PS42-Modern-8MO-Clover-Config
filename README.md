MSI PS42 Modern 8MO Clover Config

This build is worked on MacOs 11.3.1
What is worked:
1. Sound (Input/Output)
2. Wi-fi
3. Bluetooth
4. Video + HDMI (After login on OS, not with connected second screen when OS is starting)
5. Keyboard
6. Touchpad

What is not worked and I hope can be fixed:
1. Sleep mode
2. USB (USB flash is visible but USB mouse isn't)
3. Some times after quit from sleep mode I have black screen and should be rebooted the Mac with hard reset
4. After quit from sleep mode - bluetooth is stopped and not worked untill the Mac is rebooted.
